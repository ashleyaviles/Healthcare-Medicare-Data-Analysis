The Impact of Depression on Medicare Inpatient Spending, Utilization, and Patient Cost Burden

Abstract:

In the literature, depression has been linked to increased overall patient healthcare costs and increased healthcare utilization. The goal of this study was to investigate how Medicare beneficiaries’ diagnosis of depression influences their medical costs, utilization, and Medicare's overall inpatient medical expenditure. To accomplish the aforementioned goal, I conducted an exploratory analysis of a sample of CMS's 2008–2010 Medicare Data Entrepreneurs' Synthetic Public Use File (DE-SynPUF). Throughout 2008-2010, Medicare's average inpatient payment for Medicare beneficiaries that did not have depression was more than their counterparts with depression ($9,892 vs $9,391, respectively). The difference in beneficiaries' healthcare costs without depression and those with depression was also negligibly different ($1,146 vs $1,142). The study also assessed the associations between sending and depression, as well as other variables that might impact Medicare’s expenditure or members inpatient utilization and cost. Interestingly, members with depression will utilize 0.37 (p<0.00) more inpatient days than those without depression. However, contrary to the literature, depression was negatively associated with Medicare spending (p<0.00) and members' healthcare costs. However, the results were not statistically significant for members' spending on healthcare costs.
